#  OpenChat
A native SwiftUI app for chatting with Large Language Models.

This app is mainly meant to run on Apple mac, alongside a locally installed LLM. However, it's a mac catalyst app, so should also run on iPhone and iPad. Perhaps you don't have an LLM running there, but it also supports OpenAI so you could use it to interact with that.

To run, open the project in Xcode and hit run.

Use the settings menu (gear icon in top right) to choose your model provider and model name.

Currently supported LLMs are:
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)
- [LocalAI](https://localai.io)
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com)
